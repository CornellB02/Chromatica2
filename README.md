**Functionality & MVPs**

- Hover effects and onclicks: changes the color of a botton when it is hovered over and also when its clicked.   

- Brightness Effect - allows users to adjust the bightness or darkness of the video with a bar. Then allows users to play that video back with this effect on it.
